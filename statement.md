BMI Calculation and Categorization:It takes the user's weight (kg) and height (m) as input.It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula $BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}$.It then categorizes the BMI into one of four groups: "Underweight" ($\le 18.5$), "Normal weight" ($18.5$ to $24.9$), "Overweight" ($25$ to $29.9$), or "Obese" ($\ge 30$).Calorie Tracking:It sets a predefined calorie limit (Limit = 2000).It prompts the user to enter all the food items they ate from a pre-defined dictionary (food_data) that maps food names to their estimated calorie count.It continuously calculates the total_calories consumed until the user types 'done'.Dietary Suggestion:Based on the total_calories consumed compared to the Limit (2000), it provides a suggestion:If the total is less than 1000 (Limit/2), the suggestion is to add fruits or a proper meal.If the total is between 1000 and 2000 (exclusive), the suggestion is that the user can have a light snack if hungry.If the total is 2000 or more, the suggestion is to avoid heavy meals, though a fruit or two would be acceptable if hungry.Output: It prints the calculated BMI, the corresponding BMI category, the total calories consumed, and the final calorie suggestion
