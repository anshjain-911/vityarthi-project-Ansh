Hi! 
I made a simple program that calculates your BMI, tells you your BMI category, and also lets you enter the food you ate today to calculate your total calories.


-> Features
-BMI Calculator

Takes weight (kg) and height (m) from the user

Calculates BMI using a function

Shows your BMI category (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese)

-Daily Food Calorie Counter

Contains a long dictionary of common Indian foods and their calorie values

User can enter items one by one

Types "done" to finish

Program calculates total calories

Gives a simple health suggestion based on calories eaten

-> What I Learned

While making this program, I learned:

How to use functions in Python

How to work with dictionaries

How to use loops and conditions

How to take user input

How to structure a beginner project

This project really helped me understand how to put different Python concepts together.

->How to Run

Install Python (if not already installed)

Download or clone this repository

Open a terminal and run:

python smartdietplanner.py


Enter your weight and height

Type the food items you ate today

Type done when finished

The program will show:

Your BMI

BMI Category

Total calories

Suggestion for the day
